    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Meredith Gray</h1>

     Taylor's first cat, Meredith, is a female Scottish Fold cat with a special place in Taylor's Heart.
        She was adopted by the pop-star 14 years ago, 2011. Though a lot of cats are known for hating their owners, Meredith 
        shares the same amount of affection Taylor does for her. According to some sources, Meredith would often sing along to her
        "Mother"'s songs when they are played. She would also meow almost as if she was whining everytime Swift stops petting or
        brushing her fur. Just like her owner, Meredith also has a fanbase of her own. Her most popular appearance was in Deadpool 2,
        where she appeared on a character's shirt alongside her sister, Olivia, with a text below them saying, "Olivia & Meredith Best Friends Purrrrr-Ever."
        Though she and her mother, again, have lots of similarities, Olivia absolutely resents the spotlight. Taylor mentions this fact in a video with her youngest child, 
        Benjamin Button, where she tells him about the "rumors" spiraling around Meredith about the fact that she hates getting her picture taken.

        Taylor's second cat, Olivia, came three years later after her sister's adoptation. Olivia and Meredith have plenty of similarities,
        a few of them being the fact that they are both Scottish Folds and the fact they both appeared in multiple major music videos and movies. The only difference between she and her sister is the fact
        that she's more outgoing and open to the public than her older sister. She has appeared in multiple ads, examples of this being a Coca Cola ad and Taylor's AT&T ad campaign. As said a while ago, she and her sister, Meredith,
        both appeared in Deadpool 2 on an actor's shirt with a caption saying: "Olivia & Meredith Best Friends Purrrrr-Ever."

       Taylor's last and final cat, Benjamin Button, is a male ragdoll she met on the set of her music video "ME!". The cat was originally from a rescue organization
       that puts kittens on advertisements or promotional videos to help them get adopted. According to Swift, when a handler behind the music video handed her the ragdoll, she immediately
       fell in love with him and planned to take him home without a second thought. Though he doesn't show up in any advertisements unlike his sisters, he did show up with Taylor on the cover of TIME 2023.
